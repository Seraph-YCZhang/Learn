Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.
```
For example, given the following tree:

    1
   / \
  2   5
 / \   \
3   4   6
The flattened tree should look like:

1
 \
  2
   \
    3
     \
      4
       \
        5
         \
          6
```
so the idea is keeping a global variable ```prev``` to track the node whose has a flattened right child  
and we keep going back, and link the prev to the node's right child.  
Why we do it in this order, cuz in the given example, we can see that 1 2 3 4 is in a pre-order traversal.  
so we can do a reversed pre-order traversal to get the result.  

```python3
def flatten(node):
    self.prev = None
    def helper(root):
        if not root: # base case of recursion
          return None
        helper(root.right)
        helper(root.left)
        node.right = self.prev
        node.left = None
        self.prev = root
```
