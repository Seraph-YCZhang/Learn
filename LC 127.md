## Word Ladder
### Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

### Output: 
5

### Explanation:
As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog", return its length 5.

## Solution 1: Time Limit Exceeded
### Methods:
I was trying solve this bfs recursively. the time cost is O(n*(n-1)*(n-2))
```
class Solution:
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> int:
        if endWord not in wordList:
            return 0
        def helper(word, wList, length):
            for idx, w in enumerate(wList):
                count = 0
                for a,b in zip(w, word):
                    if a != b:
                        count += 1
                if count == 1:
                    if w == endWord:
                        if length < self.res:
                            self.res = length + 1
                        return 
                    else:
                        # print(w, word, count, wList[:idx]+wList[idx+1:], length + 1)
                        helper(w, wList[:idx]+wList[idx+1:], length + 1)
                        
        self.res = 65535
        helper(beginWord, wordList, 1)
        return self.res if self.res != 65535 else 0
 ```
 
## Solution 2: AC 70.87%
### Method:
Using dic1 to store all the possible combinations of every word.  
For example,  
hot => \*ot, h\*t, ho\*  
which means it can be converted from \*ot and also to \*ot  
So we go from ```beginWord```   
for here, we have hit => \*it, h\*t, hi\*  
so it can be converted to the words, which can be converted from  \*it, h\*t, hi\*  
they are or it is ```hot```  
for now we have our first word conversion hit => hot  
```
class Solution:
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> int:
        if endWord not in wordList:
            return 0
        
        dic = collections.defaultdict(list)
        L = len(beginWord)
        for w in wordList:
            for idx in range(L):
                k = w[:idx] + "*" + w[idx + 1:]
                dic[k].append(w)
        

        queue = collections.deque([(beginWord, 1)])
        visited = set(beginWord)
        # print(dic)
        while queue:
            cur, lev = queue.popleft()
            # print(cur, lev)
            for idx in range(L):
                im = cur[:idx] + "*" + cur[idx+1:]
                for w in dic[im]:
                    # print(w)
                    if w == endWord:
                        return lev + 1 
                    if w not in visited:
                        queue.append((w,lev+1))
                        visited.add(w)
        return 0
