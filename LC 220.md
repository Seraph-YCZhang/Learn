Using OrderedDic from collections library to solve the problem  
which key values are stored with order   
popitem() func can help keep it like a stack   
which is defaulted to pop the last item  
Or FIFO if set as False  

```
class Solution:
    def containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(self, nums: List[int], k: int, t: int) -> bool:
        if k < 1 or t < 0:
            return False
        dic = collections.OrderedDict()
        for idx, num in enumerate(nums):
            key = num // t if t else num
            for i in [dic.get(key-1),dic.get(key),dic.get(key+1)]:
            # for i in range(num-t,num+t+1):
                # print(num,i,dic)
                if i is not None and abs(i-num) <= t:
                        return True
            if len(dic) == k:
                dic.popitem(False)
            dic[key] = num
        return False
```

Also Bucket Sorting used here
For each iteration,  
we have a number ```num```  
Calculate its key by dividing by ```t```  

In this way, each bucket holds nums in range ```t```
and in each iteration, we need to check the current, the last, and the next bucket if there are any item meeting the requirement which <= t  

And For k requirement, we keep a k length stack like dictionary, Cuz no need to track the items more than k distance
