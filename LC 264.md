Write a program to find the n-th ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. 

Example:

Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.  
Note:  

1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
n does not exceed 1690.

Solution:  
The first ugly num is 1, so what's the next? It is 1*2 = 2. So the second ugly num is generated by 1 times 2.  
And then 3. for the next num, 5 * 1 has not been used, 3 * 2 has not been used, but 2 * 2 is the smallest.  
we have [1,2,3,4] for now, 5 * 1 is selected at this time. So in next turn, 5 can try multiplying 2. 

```python3
class Solution:
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        ugly = [1]
        i2,i3,i5 = 0,0,0
        for i in range(1,n):
            tmp_2,tmp_3,tmp_5 = 2*ugly[i2],3*ugly[i3],5*ugly[i5]
            ugly += [min(tmp_2,tmp_3,tmp_5)]
            if ugly[i] == tmp_2:
                i2+=1
            if ugly[i] == tmp_3:
                i3+=1
            if ugly[i] == tmp_5:
                i5 += 1
        return ugly[-1]
            
```
