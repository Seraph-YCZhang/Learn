Given n, how many structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1 ... n?  

1 => 1
1,2 => 
  2   1
 /      \
1         2
   
1,2,3 => if 1 as root we have 0 as left, 2,3 as right .   
but dp[0] cannot be 0, cuz needs 1 to do multiply thing, so initialize dp[0] = dp[1] = 1 . 
2,3 as right subtree => is there any difference with 1,2 tree . the vals are different, but they both have 2 elements,  
so the num of combination are the same.  

==> . And for 1...n, we need to check 1 to n as root separatly, so dp[i] = sum(dp[1 => i]) . 


So for general question, we have 1...n . 
if we choose i as root => 1....i-1 i i+1 ... n . 
left part is i-1 elements  
right part is n - i elements . 
so dp[i] = dp[i-1] * dp[n-i]
